# Provider Backends

This is the contract reference for Crabbox provider backends: the interfaces a
provider implements, how it registers, what core owns versus what the backend
owns, and the checklist to land a new one. For the step-by-step walkthrough,
read [Authoring a provider](features/provider-authoring.md) first, then use this
page as the reference and review checklist.

Read this when you are:

- adding a new Crabbox provider;
- choosing between an SSH lease backend and a delegated run backend;
- adding provider-specific flags or config;
- reviewing a provider PR for the right ownership boundary;
- designing a future external provider plugin protocol.

Every provider follows one rule:

**Providers configure backends. Core commands own workflows.**

That keeps `crabbox run`, `warmup`, `list`, `status`, `stop`, `cleanup`, Actions
hydration, sync, result collection, rendering, and timing consistent across
providers. A provider describes what it can do and returns a backend object. It
does not fork the command surface.

## Choose the backend shape

Start by picking the execution model. A provider's `Configure` returns a
`Backend`, and core inspects which interfaces that value implements.

### SSH lease backend

Use `SSHLeaseBackend` when the provider can hand Crabbox a reachable SSH target.

Examples: Hetzner Cloud, AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VMs, Proxmox, a
local Docker container, and static BYO SSH hosts.

Core owns the entire workflow after acquisition:

- claim and slug handling;
- SSH readiness checks;
- network target resolution;
- sync and sync guardrails;
- command wrapping and streaming;
- JUnit/result collection;
- Actions runner hydration over SSH;
- heartbeat/touch;
- release.

The backend owns only the provider lifecycle:

```go
type SSHLeaseBackend interface {
	Backend

	Acquire(ctx context.Context, req AcquireRequest) (LeaseTarget, error)
	Resolve(ctx context.Context, req ResolveRequest) (LeaseTarget, error)
	List(ctx context.Context, req ListRequest) ([]LeaseView, error)
	ReleaseLease(ctx context.Context, req ReleaseLeaseRequest) error
	Touch(ctx context.Context, req TouchRequest) (Server, error)
}
```

Implement this when `LeaseTarget.SSH` can be populated with host, port, user,
key, work root, target OS, and Windows mode.

When the provider's spec sets `Coordinator: CoordinatorSupported` and a broker
URL is configured (`CRABBOX_COORDINATOR`), core wraps your `SSHLeaseBackend` in
a coordinator lease backend automatically (`loadBackend` in
`internal/cli/provider_backend.go`). Lease lifecycle then flows through the
broker over HTTP, while sync and command execution still happen directly from
the CLI to the SSH host. You do not implement that wrapper; you only provide the
direct backend.

### Delegated run backend

Use `DelegatedRunBackend` when the provider owns execution itself instead of
exposing a Crabbox-managed SSH target.

Examples: Blacksmith Testbox, Blaxel, E2B, Islo, Modal, Tensorlake,
[Upstash Box](https://upstash.com/docs/box/overall/quickstart), Superserve,
Vercel Sandbox, and Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions, where the provider
owns workspace setup and command streaming.

The delegated backend owns warmup, command execution, output streaming, and
stop. Core still owns provider selection, config loading, local claims, friendly
slugs, timing summaries, and normalized list/status rendering.

If the provider needs a custom remote runner model, deployment, or sandbox image
to translate Crabbox workspaces and commands into provider-native requests, that
runner must satisfy the
[Delegated runner contract](features/delegated-runner-contract.md) before the
provider is treated as merge-ready.

```go
type DelegatedRunBackend interface {
	Backend

	Warmup(ctx context.Context, req WarmupRequest) error
	Run(ctx context.Context, req RunRequest) (RunResult, error)
	List(ctx context.Context, req ListRequest) ([]LeaseView, error)
	Status(ctx context.Context, req StatusRequest) (StatusView, error)
	Stop(ctx context.Context, req StopRequest) error
}
```

Delegated backends return normalized `StatusView` values. Rendering stays
core-owned, so provider packages should not print their own `status` or `list`
tables unless a compatibility interface explicitly asks for native output.

A delegated backend must reject run/sync options that Crabbox cannot honor
without a Crabbox-managed SSH target:

```go
if err := cli.RejectDelegatedSyncOptionsForSpec(spec, req); err != nil {
	return RunResult{}, err
}
```

Providers that declare `FeatureArchiveSync` (an archive upload of the checkout)
can declare that feature in `spec` so `--sync-only` and `--force-sync-large`
are allowed while the rest stay rejected. The helper rejects checksum sync,
full resync, local stdout/stderr captures, capture-on-fail, downloads, artifact
globs, uploaded scripts, env helpers, `--stop-after`, fresh PR checkouts, and
`--emit-proof` (unless the provider declares `FeatureRunProof`) unless another
explicit feature covers the request. Providers that execute source modules
instead of shell commands may declare `FeatureModuleRun`; then `--script` and
`--script-stdin` are accepted as module source input, while trailing shell
command argv remains rejected. Delegated artifact globs require
`FeatureRunArtifacts` and `DelegatedRunArtifactBackend`. Delegated single-file
downloads require `FeatureRunDownloads` and `DelegatedRunDownloadBackend`;
required artifacts may use either capability, but download-only providers accept
safe relative file paths instead of globs. Do not pretend a delegated provider
is SSH-like unless it has a stable SSH contract. If Crabbox cannot run rsync and
remote commands itself, use `DelegatedRunBackend`.

`--no-sync` is validated by each adapter, not inferred from `FeatureArchiveSync`:
some SDK/CLI transports support it without archive sync. An adapter that cannot
skip transfer must reject it before acquisition or provider execution. Blacksmith
Testbox does this because its native run command has no supported sync bypass.

### Optional interfaces

Add optional capabilities as small interfaces instead of widening every backend.

Provider-specific run admission belongs on the provider, beside config validation:

```go
type RunOptionsValidator interface {
	ValidateRunOptions(RunRequest) error
}
```

This hook must be side-effect-free: no `Configure`, backend creation, process
spawning, credential lookup, lease resolution, state writes, or network calls.
Core combines it with the generic delegated routing guard before normal run
configuration and before prewarm configures or warms anything for a probe.
Jobs also use this contract before acquisition or dry-run planning.
Prewarm projects the actual follow-up flags and config, excluding creation-only
flags. Its request has `ReuseLease: true` and an empty `ID` until allocation;
a nonempty `ID` also implies reuse. The display placeholder `<lease>` is never
a lease identifier. Effective lease settings and opaque provider routing are
carried in `Options`. `NoSync`, `NoHydrate`, shell mode, and command intent are
preserved. Runtime-only fields such as `Repo`, `RunID`, and `Env` may be absent;
concrete claim/cache-volume checks remain in the subsequent run. Normal run
retains its existing earlier output, environment, and profile preflights.

Backends should reuse their provider's rejection policy defensively before any
activity in direct `Run` calls. Skipping sync does not skip provider
initialization; hydration intent is separate.

Requested fixed lease IDs are optional:

```go
type IdempotentLeaseIDBackend interface {
	SupportsRequestedLeaseID() bool
}
```

Direct AWS, Machine0, Incus, and local-container backends implement this
capability; coordinator-backed leases support it through the coordinator
wrapper. External backends support it only when their configured protocol
explicitly advertises idempotent lease IDs. `crabbox warmup --lease-id` rejects
other backends before provisioning. Built-in direct adapters reuse `core.AcquireFixedLease` for
durable intent and replay mechanics while keeping resource creation,
reconciliation, and identity validation provider-owned.

Every backend that implements this capability today is an SSH-lease backend, and
those read the requested ID from `AcquireRequest.RequestedLeaseID`.
`WarmupRequest.RequestedLeaseID` is the delegated-run counterpart: core now
carries the value across the delegated warmup path, so a delegated-run adapter
that opts into `IdempotentLeaseIDBackend` receives it instead of having it
dropped. No built-in delegated-run adapter advertises the capability yet, so the
field is a contract for adapters to opt into rather than behaviour any shipped
delegated-run provider has today. Core populates either field only after
validating the flag against `cbx_<12 lowercase hex>` and taking the
fixed-acquisition lock, so a capable backend always receives the caller's exact
ID.

Cleanup is optional:

```go
type CleanupBackend interface {
	Backend

	Cleanup(ctx context.Context, req CleanupRequest) error
}
```

Pause and resume are optional:

```go
type PausableBackend interface {
	Backend

	Pause(ctx context.Context, req PauseRequest) error
	Resume(ctx context.Context, req ResumeRequest) error
}
```

Declare `FeaturePauseResume` when implementing this interface so
`crabbox providers` exposes the capability.

List JSON compatibility is optional:

```go
type JSONListBackend interface {
	Backend

	ListJSON(ctx context.Context, req ListRequest) (any, error)
}
```

`JSONListBackend` is a compatibility escape hatch for script-facing JSON shapes.
Use it only when an existing provider already exposed a JSON schema different
from the normalized `[]LeaseView` shape. Do not use it for new providers.

Provider doctor checks are optional for direct providers that can prove cheap,
non-mutating readiness:

```go
type DoctorBackend interface {
	Backend

	Doctor(ctx context.Context, req DoctorRequest) (DoctorResult, error)
}
```

Use `DoctorBackend` when a provider owns direct credentials or a delegated runner
outside the coordinator. The check must validate provider-specific readiness
without creating resources, and it must not treat unrelated coordinator health as
proof that the provider itself is configured correctly. Expose it through the
matching provider-level hook so `doctor` does not configure every provider just
to discover the optional capability:

```go
type DoctorProvider interface {
	Provider

	ConfigureDoctor(cfg Config, rt Runtime) (DoctorBackend, error)
}
```

Native checkpoint and fork support follow the same pattern through
`NativeCheckpointProvider` and `NativeCheckpointForkProvider`. Future
provider-specific capability areas should add similarly narrow interfaces
rather than widening the base backend. Live provider-owned machine catalogs use
`ProviderSizeCatalogBackend`; core exposes them through `crabbox providers sizes
<provider>` while the adapter retains size slugs, region availability, exact
microcurrency prices, and GPU metadata.

Failed-run evidence for SSH leases is also optional. A supporting backend may
capture a bounded, per-command baseline immediately before execution and return
a collector that core calls only after a nonzero exit or command-transport
failure:

```go
type SSHRunFailureEvidenceBackend interface {
	Backend
	BeginRunFailureEvidence(context.Context, RunFailureEvidenceRequest) (RunFailureEvidenceCollector, error)
}
```

The collector keeps provider-native counters and parsing inside the adapter. It
returns only normalized `RunFailureEvidence` values; initially the sole resource
exhaustion reason is `memory`. Baseline and collection errors are warnings and
must never replace the command failure. A fresh collector is created for every
command, including watch iterations and reused leases, so historical provider
counters cannot be attributed to a later run.

Exact status/heartbeat claim authorization is optional for providers with a
runtime-derived ownership scope:

```go
type StatusTouchClaimAuthorizer interface {
	AuthorizeStatusTouchClaim(context.Context, LeaseTarget, LeaseClaim) error
}
```

Core requires an exact claim for the canonical provider before calling this
hook. Implementations then own the full authorization decision; only `nil`
permits a touch. They must validate the canonical lease and resource IDs, a
non-empty current scope, and all provider-native context, endpoint, account,
daemon, or immutable runtime identity recorded by the claim. Hydration may
select the recorded runtime route, but it must not mutate or adopt ownership.
Providers without this capability retain core's exact static provider-scope
and resource comparison, plus any `StatusTouchClaimValidator` check.

## Package layout

Built-in providers live under `internal/providers/<name>`. The registry is
populated by side-effect `init()` registration, gathered in
`internal/providers/all`:

```

Each provider package owns registration, provider name, aliases, spec,
provider-specific flags, backend configuration, provider clients, provider
lifecycle code, and provider-specific tests. `cmd/crabbox` imports
`internal/providers/all` for side-effect registration:

```go
import (
	"github.com/openclaw/crabbox/internal/cli"
	_ "github.com/openclaw/crabbox/internal/providers/all"
)
```

The core provider contract lives in `internal/cli`:

```text
internal/cli/provider_backend.go      # interfaces, registry, request/result types
internal/cli/provider_coordinator.go  # brokered coordinator lease wrapper
internal/cli/provider_labels.go       # shared direct-provider label helpers
```

Provider packages may use small exported core helpers for claims, labels, sync
preflight, timing JSON, and SSH key storage. Keep that helper surface narrow: if
a provider needs broad command orchestration, the behavior probably belongs in
core instead.

Claim-only recovery adapters may use `shared.ResolveProviderClaimStrict` to
resolve an exact provider/scope-bound claim before a slug while preventing a
canonical lease ID from falling through. `shared.ValidateClaimBinding` compares
only exact structural fields and required labels; retain the complete resolved
claim, including its revision, as the snapshot for guarded mutations. Raw
provider resource IDs, recovery-state interpretation, account and key
authorization, live endpoint checks, and deletion remain adapter-owned and
must not be inferred from the shared structural result.
Use `shared.CloneLabels` for plain writable label copies; it returns an empty
non-nil map for nil input. Keep preservation helpers local when missing, empty,
and non-empty source values have provider-specific meaning.

Lifecycle polling is the exception that belongs in
`internal/providers/shared`, not command core. `shared.Poll` centralizes only
the repeated read mechanics: last-success retention, attempt limits,
context-aware waits, and optional progress. The adapter creates any timeout or
detached context and maps its cause. It also keeps native state semantics,
retryability, identity and ownership validation, side effects, diagnostics,
and exact error text; the helper does not normalize states, mutate claims,
detach contexts, call provider actions, or log.

Cross-process provider lease serialization also belongs in
`internal/providers/shared`. `shared.LockLeaseOperation` owns the in-process
semaphore, advisory file lock, retry cadence, and idempotent release. Adapters
retain provider-specific lease ID validation, namespace preparation, and
diagnostics; the provider name selects the existing on-disk lock filename.

Strict one-request/one-response JSON subprocesses may use
`internal/providers/shared/procjson`. It owns bounded capture, cancellation
grace, request encoding, and exact single-document decoding. Keep response
envelopes, versions, identity checks, redaction, and provider error semantics in
the adapter. Do not use it for noisy CLI output, streaming or NDJSON protocols,
or commands with ambiguous side effects.

Vanilla provider HTTP redirect policy also belongs in
`internal/providers/shared`. `shared.SecureHTTPClient` clones an injected
client, rejects destinations outside a trusted `shared.SameOrigin`, preserves
an existing redirect hook, and otherwise applies the standard redirect limit.
The adapter supplies the exact refusal error and retains any additional path,
method, transport, previous-hop, or provider-specific origin policy locally.

## Acquisition stays adapter-owned

SSH lease acquisition is a provider-owned transaction, not a shared sequence of
create, claim, bootstrap, and cleanup steps. Similar-looking acquisition bodies
protect different ownership windows, credential dependencies, failure policies,
and security boundaries. Share small primitives without centralizing their order.

Acquisition already shares the mechanics that have provider-neutral contracts:

- `shared.AcquireAttemptsRetry` retries eligible fresh acquisitions outside the
  individual provider transaction and preserves bootstrap-failure/keep policy.
- `core.NewLeaseID` and `core.AllocateDirectLeaseSlug` generate lease identities
  and collision-safe slugs using inventory selected by the adapter.
- `core.EnsureTestboxKeyForConfig` creates Crabbox-owned per-lease SSH keys;
  `core.ProviderKeyForLease` names provider-side keys when applicable.
- `shared.Poll` repeats observations while the adapter owns readiness predicates,
  identity checks, side effects, timeouts, and diagnostics.
- `core.SSHTargetFromConfig` constructs conventional SSH endpoints, and
  `core.WaitForSSHReady` proves the common SSH bootstrap contract.
- `shared.ClaimBinding`, `shared.ValidateClaimBinding`,
  `shared.ResolveProviderClaimStrict`, and `shared.ErrStrictClaimMismatch`
  validate structural identity and exact provider/scope-bound claim lookup;
  `shared.CloneLabels` supplies writable label copies.
- `core.AcquireFixedLease`, `core.FixedAcquireOptions`,
  `core.FixedLeaseBinding`, and `core.FixedLeaseKind` already share durable
  fixed-ID intent locking, replay validation, acquired-state commit, and
  terminal tombstones for AWS, Machine0, and local-container. Their adapters
  still own exact create attempts, provider reconciliation, and immutable
  resource identity.

The transaction boundary deliberately remains inside each adapter:

- **Claim-persistence windows:** Lume persists storage-fenced ownership before
  cloning, DigitalOcean writes a recovery claim after an ambiguous provider
  mutation, and Hetzner returns an unclaimed successful target for command core
  to claim. Moving every claim before creation or after readiness changes crash
  recovery and ownership; purchase recovery records and repeated guarded claim
  transitions likewise remain in their original provider-defined windows.
- **Rollback ordering:** Hetzner deletes its provider key before its server;
  Vultr deletes the instance first and preserves its key when instance deletion
  fails; Vast detaches its instance key before destruction. Hostinger cannot
  cancel or delete an already purchased server and may only stop it. A generic
  cleanup stack cannot preserve these access, ownership, and billing boundaries.
- **Credential ownership and ambiguous outcomes:** Morph receives a
  provider-issued private key after boot, and Machine0 materializes a
  provider-managed key and validates immutable-machine trust. Neither may be
  forced through `core.EnsureTestboxKeyForConfig`; providers with separately
  created account keys must also distinguish owned keys, reused keys, and
  unresolved mutations before deciding what to retain or delete.
- **`Keep` failure semantics:** Morph may retain a failed acquisition when
  `Keep` is true; Scaleway normally does the same but forces rollback when
  `OnAcquired` fails; Hostinger remains financially committed regardless of
  whether its purchased server is stopped. Other providers intentionally roll
  back failed creation even with `Keep`, so retention cannot be a global rule.
- **`OnAcquired` placement:** Lume acknowledges an early provisional identity,
  Vast acknowledges after readiness but before its final claim, and fixed-ID
  Machine0 and local-container acknowledge only after durable commit and lock
  release. Moving the callback changes when controller ownership transfers and
  which transaction must clean up if acknowledgment fails.
- **Security-critical bootstrap ordering:** Hyper-V locks down guest SSH before
  attaching networking; Lume pins authenticated guest identity before accepting
  SSH; Vast probes initial access, installs required tools, and only then proves
  full readiness. A universal endpoint-then-SSH sequence would erase required
  isolation, identity, or staged-bootstrap guarantees.

Review proposals to centralize acquisition orchestration against every existing
provider: they must preserve exact claim windows, rollback and credential
ordering, `Keep` failure behavior, callback placement, and security-critical
bootstrap sequencing. A preparation-only helper for IDs, slugs, and local keys
was also evaluated across ten compatible providers; its estimated savings of
only 20–70 lines did not cover the additional state, callback plumbing, and
semantic tests required by the mechanism. Keep acquisition adapter-owned unless
a future proposal proves both behavior preservation and meaningful net value.
## Delegated-run lifecycles stay adapter-owned

Delegated execution is a provider-owned transaction, not a shared sequence of
claim, create, run, retain, and cleanup steps. The common `DelegatedRunBackend`
method surface describes routing and capabilities, not a common transaction.
Share small primitives without centralizing provider lifecycle decisions.

Delegated execution already shares mechanics with provider-neutral contracts:

- `procjson.Exchange` bounds strict subprocess JSON exchanges, cancellation
  grace, and decoding; streaming bridges and provider envelopes stay local.
- `shared.Poll` repeats observations without owning state interpretation,
  readiness, deadlines, or side effects; `shared.PollDelegatedStatus` handles
  narrow status projection without centralizing provider lifecycle decisions.
- `shared.LockLeaseOperation`, `shared.LockOperation`, and
  `shared.LockOperationFile` serialize cross-process operations; adapters choose
  which transaction holds a lock and when it must be released.
- `shared.SecureHTTPClient` and `shared.SameOrigin` enforce the common redirect
  policy while preserving provider-specific transport and refusal semantics.
- `core.RunDelegatedArchiveSync` owns bounded archive preparation, upload,
  staged replacement, and cleanup; `shared.RunSandboxArchiveSync` supplies
  conventional sandbox wiring when its contract fits the provider.
- `shared.ScopedLeaseResolver`, `shared.ResolveScopedLeaseID`,
  `shared.ResolveScopedLeaseClaim`, `shared.FinishScopedLease`, and
  `shared.ValidateClaimBinding` share claim mechanics;
  `core.RemoveLeaseClaimIfUnchangedAfter` fences claim removal around an
  adapter-owned action without deciding destructive authority.
- `core.HandleDelegatedRunFailure` shares basic keep-on-failure bookkeeping;
  `shared.StartEnvdProcess` shares one execution protocol, not a lifecycle.

The transaction boundary deliberately remains inside each adapter:

- **Claim and ownership models:** Eleven of twelve sampled providers maintain
  durable local claims with materially different ownership bindings. E2B binds
  an endpoint and exact sandbox, Vercel binds project/team ownership, W&B binds
  entity/project scope, Nomad binds a job and allocation, and Cloudflare claims
  retained or recovery state. Anthropic Sandbox Runtime is stateless and has no
  claim, durable resource, warmup, or stop transaction to centralize.
- **Creation and retention:** Azure materializes sessions through runner access
  and deletes unkept warmups; W&B supplies environment only when creating a
  sandbox; Vercel must choose persistence before creation and repair tentative
  ownership; OpenSandbox reconciles ambiguous creation and enforces absolute
  lifetimes. Docker retains successful clone-mode sessions to preserve commits,
  while Cloudflare retention depends on cache mode and execution coordination.
- **Workload cancellation:** Only OpenSandbox and Blaxel explicitly attempt
  remote command cancellation, through `InterruptCommand` and `StopProcess`.
  Anthropic cancels its local workload by terminating the subprocess; E2B,
  Azure, Vercel, W&B, and AWS otherwise cancel transport without proving the
  remote command stopped. Cloudflare Durable Objects return HTTP 409 during
  active execution: removing completed metadata is not workload cancellation.
- **Cleanup ordering:** E2B and W&B hold claim transactions across verified
  remote deletion; OpenSandbox, Vercel, and AWS hold provider operation locks;
  Nomad deregisters its job, waits for scheduler convergence, confirms absence,
  and only then removes an unchanged claim. Blacksmith additionally removes a
  locally owned private key; Cloudflare deletes completed run metadata instead
  of stopping active execution. These are different ownership transactions.
- **Failure handling:** Blaxel and OpenSandbox can retain recovery claims after
  ambiguous creation; Vercel and AWS propagate cleanup failures, while other
  adapters intentionally warn. Blacksmith preserves Actions proof, artifacts,
  and workflow-cancellation diagnostics; OpenSandbox refreshes retained
  activity while enforcing absolute lifetime. Setup failures, rollback,
  keep-on-failure handling, and final result timing remain provider decisions.

Review proposals to centralize delegated-run orchestration against every
existing provider: they must preserve exact claim and ownership models,
creation and retention decisions, actual workload-cancellation guarantees,
cleanup and lock ordering, and failure-handling behavior. A lifecycle engine
that transfers these decisions into shared callbacks merely rebuilds adapter
dispatch while weakening transaction boundaries. Keep delegated-run lifecycles
adapter-owned unless a future proposal proves both per-provider behavior
preservation across these dimensions and meaningful net value.

## Provider registration

A provider implements `cli.Provider`:

```go
type Provider interface {
	Name() string
	Aliases() []string
	Spec() ProviderSpec

	RegisterFlags(fs *flag.FlagSet, defaults Config) any
	ApplyFlags(cfg *Config, fs *flag.FlagSet, values any) error

	Configure(cfg Config, rt Runtime) (Backend, error)
}
```

A minimal SSH provider package:

```go
package example

import (
	"flag"

	"github.com/openclaw/crabbox/internal/cli"
)

func init() {
	cli.RegisterProvider(Provider{})
}

type Provider struct{}

func (Provider) Name() string      { return "example" }
func (Provider) Aliases() []string { return nil }

func (Provider) Spec() cli.ProviderSpec {
	return cli.ProviderSpec{
		Name: "example",
		Kind: cli.ProviderKindSSHLease,
		Targets: []cli.TargetSpec{
			{OS: "linux"},
		},
		Features: cli.FeatureSet{
			cli.FeatureSSH,
			cli.FeatureCrabboxSync,
		},
		Coordinator: cli.CoordinatorNever,
	}
}

func (Provider) RegisterFlags(*flag.FlagSet, cli.Config) any {
	return cli.NoProviderFlags()
}

func (Provider) ApplyFlags(*cli.Config, *flag.FlagSet, any) error {
	return nil
}

func (p Provider) Configure(cfg cli.Config, rt cli.Runtime) (cli.Backend, error) {
	return cli.NewExampleLeaseBackend(p.Spec(), cfg, rt), nil
}
```

`NewExampleLeaseBackend` stands in for the backend constructor you add for the
provider. Existing providers use constructors such as `NewAWSLeaseBackend` and
`NewBlacksmithBackend`.

Then add the side-effect import in `internal/providers/all/all.go`:

```go
import _ "github.com/openclaw/crabbox/internal/providers/example"
```

Tests in `internal/cli` do not import `internal/providers/all`, because that
would create an import cycle. Register test providers from a same-package test
file when testing core dispatch.

## Provider spec

`ProviderSpec` is command-facing metadata:

```go
type ProviderSpec struct {
	Name        string
	Family      string
	Kind        ProviderKind
	Targets     []TargetSpec
	Features    FeatureSet
	Coordinator CoordinatorMode
	// TailscaleEgressOnly marks FeatureTailscale as outbound userspace access,
	// not a bidirectional peer endpoint.
	TailscaleEgressOnly bool
}
```

Use canonical provider names in docs and config. Aliases are for compatibility
only. `Family` groups related providers so a flag set by one can route to a
sibling (for example, the Azure family covers `azure` and
`azure-dynamic-sessions`); leave it empty to default to the provider name.

Pick `Kind` carefully:

- `ProviderKindSSHLease`: provider returns SSH targets and Crabbox owns sync/run.
- `ProviderKindDelegatedRun`: provider owns execution and output streaming.
- `ProviderKindServiceControl`: provider inspects or controls an existing
  hosted service instead of leasing a run surface (for example `railway` and
  `fastapi-cloud`).

`Targets` should describe what the provider can actually satisfy. Use `linux`,
`macos`, or `windows` only for real operating-system targets. Use
`worker-runtime` for Worker-isolate or module-runtime providers that execute
source in a hosted runtime without POSIX shell, SSH, filesystem sync, ports, or
desktop semantics. Do not list `windows`, `macos`, `desktop`, `browser`, or
`code` unless the backend supports that path end to end.

Feature flags are concrete capability declarations:

Actions runner hydration is intentionally not a provider feature. It is a core
SSH-over-Linux/Windows workflow that requires an SSH lease backend, a
`linux`/`windows` target, and no delegated execution.

Set `CoordinatorSupported` only when the Crabbox broker can provision that
provider. Today that is the managed cloud set (`aws`, `azure`, `daytona`, `gcp`,
`hetzner`). A direct-only SSH provider should use `CoordinatorNever`. Even a
`CoordinatorSupported` provider runs direct from the CLI until a broker URL/token
is configured.

Checkpoint-related features are reserved for versioned workspaces:

- `FeatureCheckpoint`: provider can create a provider-aware checkpoint.
- `FeatureFork`: provider can create a new workspace from a checkpoint.
- `FeatureRestore`: provider can restore an existing workspace to a checkpoint.
- `FeatureSnapshot`: provider can expose a native snapshot id for Crabbox
  metadata.
- `FeatureCacheVolume`: provider can mount keyed rebuildable cache volumes on
  warmup/run.
- `FeatureRunProof`: delegated provider can return bounded stream/timing metadata
  for core `crabbox run --emit-proof` rendering.
- `FeatureRunSession`: exposes a provider-neutral run-session handle. Delegated
  adapters may return it in `RunResult`; an explicitly opted-in SSH-lease
  provider may have core emit it after claim recording. SSH participants must
  also advertise `FeatureSSH` and `FeatureCleanup`. AWS and `local-container`
  use this core-owned SSH contract; providers do not construct the handle
  themselves. A brokered run ID identifies coordinator history, while a direct
  run ID is only local correlation metadata.
- `FeatureRunArtifacts`: delegated provider can validate and collect bounded run
  artifact globs after a successful command, including required artifacts.
- `FeatureRunDownloads`: delegated provider can materialize bounded single-file
  downloads and validate safe relative single-file required artifacts after a
  successful command.
- `FeatureModuleRun`: delegated provider accepts `--script` or `--script-stdin`
  as source module input and does not interpret trailing argv as a shell command.
- `FeatureMCP`: delegated provider can attach MCP server references during
  sandbox creation.
- `FeatureArchiveSync`: provider syncs the checkout as an uploaded archive rather
  than over rsync.
- `FeatureURLBridge`: delegated provider can expose a lease's port through the
  broker URL bridge.

Do not set the checkpoint flags for plain SSH access alone. Generic
Git/archive/log checkpoints are core-owned and work even when a provider
advertises no native checkpoint features.

`crabbox providers --json` also exposes a normalized `workspace` array derived
from these feature flags:

| Feature | Workspace capability |
| --- | --- |
| `FeatureCheckpoint` | `checkpoint` |
| `FeatureFork` | `fork` |
| `FeatureRestore` | `restore` |
| `FeatureSnapshot` | `snapshot-ref` |

Use that normalized field for workflow selection and external comparisons. Keep
provider-specific snapshot names, CRDs, image IDs, and fork engines behind the
provider adapter.

The same provider matrix exposes normalized run-evidence capabilities:

| Feature | Evidence capability |
| --- | --- |
| `FeatureRunProof` | `proof` |
| `FeatureRunArtifacts` | `artifacts` |
| `FeatureRunDownloads` | `downloads` |
| `FeatureURLBridge` | `preview-url` |
| `FeatureRunSession` | `session` |

`providers recommend run-evidence` requires at least one proof, artifact,
download, or preview-url capability. A bare session handle is useful metadata,
but it is not enough by itself to claim the provider returns user-facing
evidence.

## Flags and config

Provider flags are registered before parsing because Go's `flag` package rejects
unknown flags. `RegisterFlags` must be cheap and side-effect free. It returns an
opaque values struct passed back into `ApplyFlags` only after config and common
flags select the provider.

The same real registration is the source for `crabbox providers describe`.
Discovery passes `baseConfig()` compiled defaults, attributes flags added by
each `Provider.RegisterFlags` invocation, and treats everything else registered
by `run` as a shared command flag. It never calls `ApplyFlags` or `Configure`.
Do not add a parallel flag inventory.

Pattern for a provider with typed config fields:

```go
type exampleFlagValues struct {
	Region *string
}

func (Provider) RegisterFlags(fs *flag.FlagSet, defaults cli.Config) any {
	return exampleFlagValues{
		Region: fs.String("example-region", defaults.Example.Region, "Example region"),
	}
}

func (Provider) ApplyFlags(cfg *cli.Config, fs *flag.FlagSet, values any) error {
	v, ok := values.(exampleFlagValues)
	if !ok {
		return nil
	}
	if cli.FlagWasSet(fs, "example-region") {
		cfg.Example.Region = *v.Region
	}
	return nil
}
```

Custom repeatable string-list values must also implement `flag.Getter` and
return a defensive `[]string` copy. Discovery supports standard string, bool,
int, int64, float64, and duration values and fails closed on any other custom
getter type. Routing names from `ProviderRoutingFlagProvider` and create-only
names from `ProviderCreationOnlyFlagProvider` must resolve to flags registered
by that provider.

Register renamed compatibility flags with their canonical spelling and annotate
them in place with `cli.MarkFlagDeprecated(fs, "old-name", "new-name")`. The
annotation checks that both registered flags exist, feeds discovery metadata,
and leaves help, parsing, and provider-owned canonical-wins application logic
unchanged.

`Config` does not have a generic provider config bag. New provider packages
should either add typed config fields and use `cli.FlagWasSet` from the provider
package, or expose a small provider-specific flag helper from `internal/cli` (as
Blacksmith does) when the config type is not ready to export cleanly.

If a provider needs durable config, add typed config fields in `Config` and env
overrides in `config.go`.

Never pass provider secrets as command-line arguments. Use environment variables,
local SDK config, the broker, or a credential store outside repo config.

## Runtime

Backends receive a narrow runtime:

```go
type Runtime struct {
	Stdout io.Writer
	Stderr io.Writer
	Clock  Clock
	HTTP   *http.Client
	Exec   CommandRunner
}
```

Use it instead of `App`, global clocks, or package-level command hooks.

Delegated CLI integrations must use `Runtime.Exec`:

```go
result, err := rt.Exec.Run(ctx, cli.LocalCommandRequest{
	Name:   "provider-cli",
	Args:   args,
	Stdout: rt.Stdout,
	Stderr: rt.Stderr,
})
```

This gives tests a fake command runner and avoids package-level
`exec.CommandContext` seams. Use `Runtime.Clock` for timing and `Runtime.Stdout`
/ `Runtime.Stderr` for streaming and warnings.

## Implementing an SSH lease backend

An SSH lease backend returns a complete `LeaseTarget`:

```go
type LeaseTarget struct {
	Server      Server
	SSH         SSHTarget
	LeaseID     string
	Coordinator *CoordinatorClient
}
```

`Acquire` should:

1. validate direct-provider prerequisites;
2. mint or accept the lease id handled by the request path;
3. ensure or install the SSH key;
4. provision the machine or sandbox;
5. wait until an address exists;
6. populate `SSHTarget`;
7. wait for SSH readiness when the provider owns boot;
8. mark provider labels/tags as ready;
9. return `LeaseTarget`.

`Resolve` should accept canonical lease IDs, provider IDs, names, and slugs where
the provider can support them. It should return the stored per-lease SSH key when
available.

`List` returns normalized `LeaseView` values. Do not print from `List`; command
rendering belongs to core.

`Touch` should update provider labels/tags with idle and state metadata when the
provider supports it. `TouchRequest.IdleTimeoutOverride` is non-nil only for an
explicit replacement; omission must preserve the persisted timeout. Static and
local-runtime providers must atomically compare-and-swap lifecycle labels and
an optional timeout into the exact canonical local claim, then reconstruct
later `Resolve` results from that claim. `Touch` must require the exact claim
snapshot carried by `Resolve` and revalidate ownership before the CAS. An
in-memory-only touch is not durable enough for heartbeat.

`ReleaseLease` should be idempotent where practical. Remove local claims after the
provider release succeeds or is known to be unnecessary.

If cleanup is meaningful, implement `CleanupBackend`. Cleanup should honor
`DryRun`, log skip/delete decisions to stderr, and use provider labels to avoid
deleting unrelated machines.

Direct providers that authorize cleanup from an exact local claim should set
`DirectSSHBackend.PrepareCleanup`. Core expiration and `keep` filtering runs
first; the preparation hook then performs read-only provider/account/claim
validation, attaches the exact revisioned claim snapshot to its returned
`Server`, and returns a typed skip reason when the candidate is ineligible.
Shared cleanup then reapplies the expiration/keep gate to both the refreshed
server and its carried claim, so a renewal observed during preparation wins.
Dry-run still calls this read-only preparation but never calls `Delete`.
`CleanupEligible` remains available for unmigrated adapters, but a backend must
not configure both hooks.

The matching delete path must require the carried snapshot and pass it to
`RemoveLeaseClaimIfUnchangedAfter`. Put only the provider delete (or a no-op for
a confirmed-absent resource) in that action: do not read, update, or remove
claims while the claim lock is held. If recovery must first bind a discovered
resource, durably CAS that update before the final lock and use the returned
claim as the new expected snapshot. Remove stored keys only after the locked
provider action and durable claim removal both succeed. This closes the unsafe
validate-then-delete window where a lease can be renewed or reclaimed between
authorization and provider mutation.

## Implementing a delegated run backend

A delegated backend should preserve Crabbox ergonomics while letting the provider
own the remote workflow.

`Warmup` should:

1. validate provider-specific workflow config;
2. create or warm the provider resource;
3. claim the resource locally with provider name and slug;
4. print the standard warmup summary;
5. write timing JSON when requested.

`Run` should:

1. reject unsupported Crabbox sync options;
2. acquire a resource or resolve an existing id/slug;
3. claim/reclaim the resource for the repo;
4. stream provider output through `Runtime.Stdout` and `Runtime.Stderr`;
5. return `RunResult`;
6. stop temporary resources when `Keep` is false.

`List` and `Status` should return normalized views. If the provider only offers a
table or lossy native status shape, keep that parsing inside the backend.

`Stop` should stop the provider resource, remove local claims, and remove local
per-resource keys if the backend created them.

Do not make delegated providers support `crabbox ssh`, `vnc`, `webvnc`,
`screenshot`, `code`, or Actions runner hydration unless the provider exposes a
stable connection contract that preserves Crabbox's security boundary.

## Rendering

Backends return values. Core renders output.

`ListRequest` and `StatusRequest` intentionally do not carry JSON flags. The
command handler decides whether to render human output or JSON.

`JSONListBackend` is the only exception, for compatibility with older
script-facing JSON schemas. It should not be used for new providers.

That rule keeps `crabbox list --json`, `crabbox status --json`, human tables, and
future UI/plugin consumers consistent across backend kinds.

## External provider plugins

External process plugins are not implemented yet. Do not add a provider that
depends on an undocumented stdio protocol.

The intended direction is:

- a built-in Go provider package discovers and configures the external process;
- the process speaks JSON over stdio;
- the Go side adapts it to `SSHLeaseBackend` or `DelegatedRunBackend`;
- core commands still render list/status and own SSH workflows where applicable.

Expected rough command shape:

```text
provider-plugin capabilities
provider-plugin acquire
provider-plugin resolve
provider-plugin list
provider-plugin release
provider-plugin touch
provider-plugin run
provider-plugin status
provider-plugin stop
```

The external protocol should not bypass the backend interfaces. It is an
implementation detail behind a normal registered provider.

## Tests

Add tests at the lowest level that proves the contract.

For provider registration:

- canonical name resolves through `ProviderFor`;
- aliases resolve where promised;
- `Spec` has the expected kind, targets, features, and coordinator mode;
- provider-specific flags apply only after selection.

For SSH lease backends:

- acquire success returns a `LeaseTarget` with host, user, port, key, lease id;
- acquire failure releases partial resources when possible;
- resolve supports lease id and supported aliases;
- list returns normalized views without printing;
- touch updates labels/tags and honors state/idle timeout;
- release removes claims and provider resources;
- cleanup honors dry-run.

For delegated run backends:

- sync-only/checksum/force-large options are rejected as the spec dictates;
- new run acquires, claims, streams, and stops when `Keep=false`;
- existing id/slug resolves and claims correctly;
- list/status parse provider output into normalized views;
- stop removes claims and local keys;
- all subprocess calls go through `Runtime.Exec`.

Use fake `CommandRunner`, fake clocks, fake HTTP clients, and provider test
clients. Avoid live provider calls in unit tests.

Run at least:

```sh
go test -count=1 ./internal/cli ./internal/providers/...
go test -count=1 ./...
go vet ./...
scripts/check-docs.sh
```

For high-risk provider changes, also run:

```sh
go test -race -count=1 ./internal/cli
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox
```

Add live smoke only when credentials and cost boundaries are explicit.

## Review checklist

Before landing a new backend:

- The provider has a folder under `internal/providers/<name>`.
- The provider is imported by `internal/providers/all`.
- `Name` is canonical and docs use that name.
- Compatibility aliases are intentional and tested.
- `ProviderSpec.Kind` matches the real execution model.
- `Family` is set when the provider routes flags to a sibling.
- Targets and features describe implemented behavior only.
- Coordinator mode is `CoordinatorNever` unless the broker can provision it.
- Provider flags are registered before parse and applied only after selection.
- Secrets are not stored in repo config or passed in argv.
- `list` and `status` return normalized values instead of printing.
- Delegated providers reject unsupported sync options.
- SSH providers do not own core sync/run/rendering.
- Tests cover command dispatch and backend behavior without live credentials.
- Docs and the [source map](source-map.md) are updated.
