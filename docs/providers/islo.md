# Islo Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: islo`;
- configuring the Islo sandbox image, sizing, snapshot, or gateway profile;
- changing `internal/providers/islo`.

Islo is a delegated-run provider. Crabbox uses the Islo Go SDK for sandbox
lifecycle (create, list, status, pause, resume) and calls the HTTP API directly
for delete (an empty-body `DELETE`), archive upload, shares, and command
output — reading a Server-Sent Events stream from the
`POST /sandboxes/{name}/exec/stream` endpoint. Islo owns sandbox state and
command transport; Crabbox owns local config, repo claims, sync manifests and
guardrails, slugs, timing summaries, and normalized
`list`/`status` rendering. There is no Crabbox SSH lease and no broker
coordinator — the CLI talks to Islo directly.

## When to use

Use Islo when the remote Linux sandbox should be owned by Islo and commands run
through Islo's API. Choose AWS, Hetzner, Static SSH, or Daytona instead when you
need Crabbox-managed SSH access to the box.

Islo is Linux-only. Desktop, browser, code, Actions hydration, and SSH-based run
options are not available.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider islo --islo-image docker.io/library/ubuntu:26.04
crabbox run --provider islo -- pnpm test
crabbox run --provider islo --id swift-crab --shell 'pnpm install && pnpm test'
crabbox status --provider islo --id swift-crab --wait
crabbox pause --provider islo swift-crab
crabbox resume --provider islo swift-crab
crabbox heartbeat --provider islo swift-crab
crabbox stop --provider islo swift-crab
crabbox list --provider islo --json
```

`warmup` keeps the sandbox until an explicit `stop`. The lease ID, slug, or
Crabbox-created sandbox name printed by `warmup`/`run` can be passed to later
commands via `--id`.

If local claim state was intentionally lost, adopt a canonical Islo sandbox
before lifecycle mutation, then use its new claim normally:

```sh
crabbox run --provider islo --id isb_crabbox-repo-abcdef --reclaim --no-sync -- true
crabbox stop --provider islo --id isb_crabbox-repo-abcdef
```

Read-only status lookup can still use a canonical sandbox name without a claim.
Delete, pause, resume, SSH reuse, and delegated reuse cannot.

## Auth

```sh
export ISLO_API_KEY=ak_...
```

`CRABBOX_ISLO_API_KEY` is also accepted and takes precedence over
`ISLO_API_KEY`. Do not pass the key as a command-line argument.

`ISLO_BASE_URL` (or `CRABBOX_ISLO_BASE_URL`, or `islo.baseUrl`) overrides the
default API base URL `https://api.islo.dev`.

## Config

```yaml
provider: islo
target: linux
islo:
  baseUrl: https://api.islo.dev
  image: docker.io/library/ubuntu:26.04
  workdir: crabbox
  gatewayProfile: ""
  snapshotName: ""
  vcpus: 2
  memoryMB: 4096
  diskGB: 20
```

Provider flags (each overrides the matching `islo.*` config key):

```text
--islo-base-url
--islo-image
--islo-workdir
--islo-gateway-profile
--islo-snapshot-name
--islo-vcpus
--islo-memory-mb
--islo-disk-gb
```

Every key also reads a `CRABBOX_ISLO_*` environment variable, which takes
precedence over the config file: `CRABBOX_ISLO_BASE_URL`, `CRABBOX_ISLO_IMAGE`,
`CRABBOX_ISLO_WORKDIR`, `CRABBOX_ISLO_GATEWAY_PROFILE`,
`CRABBOX_ISLO_SNAPSHOT_NAME`, `CRABBOX_ISLO_VCPUS`, `CRABBOX_ISLO_MEMORY_MB`,
and `CRABBOX_ISLO_DISK_GB`.

The resolved defaults are kept in Crabbox config for display and override
compatibility, but the Islo create request omits implicit default `image`,
`vcpus`, `memoryMB`, and `diskGB` values so Islo can use the tenant's current
defaults. Values explicitly supplied through config, environment, or flags are
still sent, including values equal to the Crabbox defaults.

### Gateway profile

`--islo-gateway-profile` / `islo.gatewayProfile` accepts an Islo gateway
profile name or id. Crabbox passes the value opaquely in the sandbox create
request; the profile itself is created and managed on the Islo side and
configures Islo's own egress gateway for the sandbox. It is unrelated to the
Crabbox coordinator. When unset, the field is omitted from the create request
so Islo applies its own default.

### Workdir resolution

`--islo-workdir` / `islo.workdir` is a relative directory below `/workspace`
(default `crabbox`, so the workspace is `/workspace/crabbox`). Crabbox validates
this before sandbox creation, then applies it to archive upload and command
execution rather than the create request. Absolute paths and `..` escapes are
rejected before workspace preparation and sync.

## Lifecycle

1. Create or resolve a Crabbox-owned Islo sandbox. New sandboxes are named
   `crabbox-<repo>-<hex>`; the local lease ID is the sandbox name prefixed with
   `isb_`, paired with a friendly slug.
2. Write a local repo claim binding the lease to the current checkout.
3. Validate the workdir, build the Crabbox sync manifest, and upload a gzipped
   archive into `/workspace/<workdir>` through Islo's files-archive API. If that
   upload fails, Crabbox falls back to a base64 chunked upload over the exec
   endpoint.
4. Execute the command through Islo's streaming exec endpoint in that workdir.
5. Require an `exit` event before treating a stream as successful.
6. Delete the sandbox on release unless the lease is kept.

`crabbox status --wait` polls the sandbox every 2 seconds until it reports
`running`, bounded by `--wait-timeout` (default 5 minutes). If the sandbox
enters a terminal state (`failed`, `stopped`, `stopping`, or `deleted`) before
becoming ready, the wait fails fast with exit code 5 instead of polling out
the deadline; hitting the deadline also exits 5.

`crabbox ssh` resolves the sandbox before rendering the SSH command: a paused
sandbox is resumed automatically and given up to 2 minutes to report `running`
again before the command fails. A sandbox in a terminal state fails
immediately with exit code 5.

## Capabilities

- SSH: yes for direct login to existing Crabbox-created sandboxes. `crabbox ssh
  --provider islo --id <slug>` renders `ssh islo@<sandbox>.islo` on port 22
  by default. Crabbox still does not use SSH for Islo `run` or sync.
- Crabbox sync: yes, archive sync through the Islo files-archive API, with a
  base64 exec-upload fallback.
- URL bridge: yes. Exposed ports become public HTTPS shares through Islo's
  `/sandboxes/{name}/shares` API, surfaced by `--expose` and the pond bridge
  plane. Share creation is idempotent per port. Requested TTLs are clamped
  into Islo's legal 60s–7d range, and an existing share is only reused while
  it has more than 30 seconds left before expiry, so a nearly-expired share is
  replaced instead of handed out.
- Pause / resume: yes. `crabbox pause` snapshots the sandbox to disk and frees
  its CPU/memory via Islo's pause API; `crabbox resume` restores it. The lease
  claim is preserved across a pause.
- Heartbeat: yes. `crabbox heartbeat` runs one no-op exec (`true`) against the
  sandbox, because Islo exposes no dedicated heartbeat endpoint. An exec is what
  registers sandbox activity: a sandbox left idle past its
  `lifecycle.pause_after_idle` window pauses on its own, and an exec against a
  paused sandbox resumes it. The exec touches no filesystem state and prints
  nothing on success.

  The command makes exactly two calls, a `GET` and the exec, and writes no
  lifecycle policy at all, so it cannot move the absolute deadline
  (`pause_after` or `delete_after`) in either direction. It also persists
  nothing: the reported `lastTouchedAt` is when the sandbox was observed, so
  `crabbox claims` keeps showing the claim's previous `lastUsed`.

  The reported idle window is read from the live sandbox: `GET /sandboxes/{name}`
  echoes `lifecycle` back, so `pause_after_idle` is reported when the sandbox
  carries one. Crabbox never sends `lifecycle` on create, so any policy a
  sandbox carries comes from Islo-side defaults Crabbox is not told about. When
  the echoed lifecycle has no `pause_after_idle`, the command reports no idle
  timeout and warns that it has no idle deadline to defer. `--idle-timeout` is
  refused: Islo exposes no endpoint that changes a live sandbox's lifecycle.

  A paused or terminal sandbox is refused rather than exec'd. The exec would
  resume a paused sandbox and that resume is billed — on a tenant with no credit
  the same call is rejected with HTTP 402 `BILLING_NOT_ALLOWED` ("Insufficient
  credit balance to resume a sandbox") — so a heartbeat must never be what
  starts billing compute.
- Bounded run downloads: yes. Safe relative single-file `--require-artifact`
  and `--download` requests are retrieved through Islo exec after command
  success and capped at 64 KiB per file.
- Desktop / browser / code: no.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator (broker): no — always direct from the CLI.

## Gotchas

- Direct SSH requires the authenticated Islo CLI and a one-time `islo ssh
  --setup`. The Islo CLI reads `islo login` state or `ISLO_API_KEY`;
  `CRABBOX_ISLO_API_KEY` alone only authenticates Crabbox.
- `--sync-only` and `--checksum` are rejected because `run` still uses Islo's
  delegated archive/exec transport, not Crabbox-managed rsync.
- `--full-resync`, `--force-sync-large`, `--script`, `--script-stdin`,
  `--fresh-pr`, `--env-helper`, local stdout/stderr captures,
  `--capture-on-fail`, `--artifact-glob`, `--emit-proof`, and `--stop-after`
  are rejected because Islo owns sync and command transport in delegated-run
  mode. Required artifacts and downloads accept only bounded single files, not
  globs, absolute paths, URLs, `.git`, or `.crabbox` paths.
- `--keep-on-failure` keeps a newly created failed sandbox until an explicit
  `stop` or provider-side expiry.
- Large-sync guardrails still apply. Because `--force-sync-large` is rejected,
  trim the checkout (more `.gitignore`/sync excludes) when a sync trips the
  large-archive guardrail.
- `--shell` passes the raw shell string to `bash -lc` in the workdir.
- `--id` accepts a Crabbox slug, an `isb_<name>` lease ID, or a canonical
  normalized sandbox name starting with `crabbox-`. A claimless canonical name
  is read-only until an explicit supported `--reclaim` reuse persists a local
  claim. Names that require case, whitespace, or punctuation normalization and
  non-Crabbox sandboxes are rejected.

## Live testing

Two opt-in smoke tests in `internal/providers/islo/backend_live_test.go`
(build tag `smoke`) exercise the real Islo API. Neither runs in the default
`go test -race ./...` job, and both skip in `go test -short` mode. Both read
`ISLO_API_KEY` only — `CRABBOX_ISLO_API_KEY`, which authenticates normal
Crabbox runs, is not consulted — and skip when it is unset.

Read-only status classification (lists live sandboxes against
`https://api.islo.dev`, mutates nothing):

```sh
export ISLO_API_KEY=ak_...
go test -tags smoke -run TestLiveIsloStatusClassification -v ./internal/providers/islo
```

Full pause/resume lifecycle (creates, pauses, resumes, runs a command in, and
deletes a real sandbox — separately opt-in because it mutates paid provider
state):

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE_ISLO_PAUSE_RESUME=1 ISLO_API_KEY=... \
  go test -tags smoke -run TestLiveIsloPauseResumeLifecycle -v ./internal/providers/islo
```

The lifecycle test honors `ISLO_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.islo.dev`) and
`CRABBOX_LIVE_ISLO_IMAGE` (default `docker.io/library/ubuntu:26.04`). After it
captures the lease ID, it attempts to delete the sandbox on exit even when a
later assertion fails. If setup fails before lease capture or the process is
interrupted, remove the leftover `crabbox-pause-resume-live-*` sandbox through
the `--reclaim` adoption flow above followed by `crabbox stop`, or delete it on
the Islo side.
