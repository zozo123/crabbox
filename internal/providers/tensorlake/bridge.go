// Tensorlake is a serverless function platform — runs are scheduled as
// invocations of registered Tensorlake functions, not as long-lived sandboxes
// with their own HTTPS ingress. There is no per-sandbox URL on the lease
// record because there is no per-sandbox endpoint in the platform; ingress is
// owned by Tensorlake's central API.
//
// As with modal and cloudflare, the adapter implements core.BridgeProvider
// only to return core.ErrBridgeNotImplemented so the resolver flags the peer
// with BridgeState="unsupported" instead of silently emitting an empty Targets
// slice that callers could misread as "no shares yet".

// PublishPeer reports that Tensorlake does not participate in the bridge plane.
