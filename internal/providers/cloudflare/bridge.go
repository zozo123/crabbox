// Cloudflare Container sandboxes are reached through a single Worker URL
// gated by a bearer token. There is no per-sandbox HTTPS preview that an
// unrelated peer could dial without that token — the runner is the only
// authorised caller. The bridge plane is HTTP-only and intentionally
// requires public per-sandbox ingress, so cloudflare is explicitly
// unsupported rather than silently broken.
//
// The adapter still satisfies core.BridgeProvider so the resolver tags the
// peer as `BridgeState="unsupported"`, which surfaces the gap to callers via
// `crabbox pond peers` instead of pretending the peer has no targets yet.

// PublishPeer reports that Cloudflare does not participate in the bridge plane.
